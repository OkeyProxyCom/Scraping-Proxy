# Scraping-Proxy
In this article, we’ll take a look at what is proxy scarping, why use proxies for web scraping, types of web scraping proxy, and how to use proxy for web scraping.

# What Are Scraping Proxies?
A scraping proxy is a server that acts as an intermediary between a web scraper (the client) and the website being scraped. When a scraper sends a request to a website, it goes through the proxy server first, which then forwards the request to the website. The website’s response also passes through the proxy before reaching the scraper. The primary purpose of a scraping proxy is to mask the scraper’s IP address, thus protecting the scraper from being detected and blocked by the website.

# Types of Web Scraping Proxies
1. Datacenter Proxies: These are the most common type of proxy. They are not affiliated with ISPs and are instead provided by a third-party service, giving you a private and anonymous IP address. While they are faster and more affordable than residential proxies, they are also easier for websites to detect and block. And there’s a higher risk of being flagged and blacklisted by certain sites.
   
2. Residential Proxies: These are IP addresses provided by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to homeowners. They are highly anonymous and hard for websites to detect or block. They’re known to be more secure compared to datacenter proxies and can be more expensive.
Rotating Proxies: These proxies automatically change the IP address they assign to your requests at regular intervals. This rotation makes it difficult for websites to detect and block your scraping activities.

3. Public Proxies: Public proxies are free to scrap and are one of the most accessible options. This is why they are often used by multiple users simultaneously. But they have slower connection speeds compared to private proxies, which makes web scraping more difficult. In addition, public proxies are unreliable and are particularly susceptible to crashes and malicious viruses and attacks.

4. Anonymous Proxies: Just as the name says: it keeps your identity anonymous. While a public proxy cannot guarantee the confidentiality of your IP address, an anonymous proxy can. They can be used by multiple users simultaneously like public proxies. However, continued usage depends on the number of current users. Spammers often use anonymous proxies, which can result in the entire proxy being banned for some sites because it uses the same IP address for all users.
